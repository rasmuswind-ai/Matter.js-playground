# ðŸ‘¾ Ragdoll Game

## Why?
I've created this small ragdoll game to play around and develop my skills with JavaScript, and see what is possible with a little bit of imagination :)

Until now, I've only been playing around with web development - This project will advance my skill further, and learn some new features in JavaScript.
This repo will basically be a little sandbox where I play around with a bunch of different code ðŸ™Œ

## Languages
