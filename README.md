# ðŸ‘¾ Matter.js Playground
## Why?
I've created this small playground to play around and develop my skills with JavaScript, and see what is possible with a little bit of imagination :)

I will be utilizing the matter.js physics engine for this project.

Until now, I've only been playing around with web development - This project will advance my skill further, and learn some new features in JavaScript.
This repo will basically be a little sandbox where I play around with a bunch of different code ðŸ™Œ
